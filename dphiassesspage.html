				<p class="props">The Problem</p>
				<p>With the constant need for hiring into an existing team or into a new business or organization, loads of recruiters struggle with repetitively coming up with tasks that can help filter through tons of applications, leaving just the right candidates to interview. Also, recruiters struggle with the following as well:
				<br><em>1. Repetitively creating tasks every time there’s a need for hiring </em><br>
				<em>2.Managing hiring history</em><br>
				<em>3.Easily managing the hiring process</em><br>
				<em>4.If platforms already exist, they were too complex or needed too much technical know-how</em>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p>My Role</p>
				<p>I was assigned a few landing pages to work on while some where assigned to other designers.<br><br>
					The ones I was assigned are the DPhi’s main homepage, individual landing page, live-session landing page, assessment landing page,about us page, business landing page.<br><br>
					I was the sole UI designer for these pages while feedback was delivered by the UX team as well as the project manager, the engineering team, other ui designers and ocassionally, the product owner.

				<p class="props">Analysing The Problem</p>
				<p>I, the UX team and the project manager had a quick virtual meetup to discuss the Product Requirement Document created by the Project manager and the UX Team. After the meeting had ended, I had to re-look at the document for a while to see if I might have a doubt or suggestion and so on.
				Apparently, the document was vast enough and excited to work on a full-scale project asides landing pages I had done in the past, refrained me from having a need for more pre-discussions.<br><br>
				So, I began...

				<p>Competitive Analysis</p>
				<p>I began with competitive analysis, with the guidance of the UX team.
					My thoughts were in the region of what type of assessment platforms already exists out there and where can I find them.
					<br>Google definitely, it saves stress and time...<br><br>
					<strong>So, I inputted certain keywords like:</strong><br><br>
					<em>Hiring platforms online</em><br><br>
					<em>Hiring Developers online</em><br><br>
					<em>Assessment Platforms Online into google.</em><br><br>
					<em>And trust google, it fed with tons of search results.</em>

				<p>A few stuck out eventually, since I was working for a firm in India but with workers across continents,<br><br>
				<strong>I filtered through to the Indian hiring platforms such as:</strong>
				<br><br>
				<em>Datacamp for Business</em>
				<br><br>
				<em>Hackerearth</em>
				<br><br>
				<em>Hackerrank</em>
				<br><br>
				<em>Dataquest</em>
				<br><br>
				You might be wondering why I stuck with solely data-centered platforms. It simply because as a company, DPhi is a data science focused organization with the aim of building the largest data community in India and in the world.
				So, I filtered through more search results and also explored suggestions from the UX team, engineering team and other designers that I hadn’t explored.

					<em>Search and read some reviews on each platform I added to the competitive analysis sheet that was created by the UX team</em>

				<p class="props">First In-Project Meetup</p>
				<p>So, the team met to discuss the findings from the sub-quantitative research and comprehensively expanded on each finding, sharing personal discoveries and ideas on how to progress to defining our problem statement.
				<br><br>
				<strong>The key focus of the post-meetup were centered around the following:</strong>
				<br><br>
				<em>How might we make the hiring platform for business owners seamless enough that it can 
				provide the best set of employees for a given field with the least amount of effort required.</em>
				<br><br>
				<em>How might we  make the weaknesses we’ve discovered a part of our strength</em>
				<br><br>
				<em>How might we ensure the seamless communication between hiring managers and 
				candidates via the platform without making it look like a spam or bother.</em>

				<p>During the project breakdown, I explored why hiring managers would love to be onboarded 		on our platform.

					In a third person’s voice based on the few findings online...
					<br><br>
					<strong>I decided to center the project around these two user stories:</strong>
					<br><br>
					<em>As a hiring manager, I would love to easily schedule a variety of hiring challenges and filter only the top for a 1-on-1 interview.</em>
					<br><br>
					<em>As a hiring manager, I would love to be able to retrace previous applicants, should there be a need to reconsider them in the future.</em>

				<p>Asides, the regular, daily stand-up meetings, project meetup are specific to project roadblocks, brainstorming and more, since we all work remotely.
				<br><br>
				This meetup was for me to present my work to the team. At this point, I had gotten the low-fi designs up to a reasonable extent.
				The aim of the meeting for me was to get feedback on the direction of the project.
				<br><br>
				<strong>The key focus of the post-meetup were centered around the following:</strong>
				<br><br>
				<em>How the solution  solved the problem statement I had come up with.</em>
				<br><br>
				<em>What the team thought about the information architecture of the solution</em>
				<br><br>
				<em>How well the visual placement of elements resonates with the team (Just opinions). Since the main judgement is in the high-fidelity designs. </em>
				<br><br>
				As it should be, there were feedbacks provided from every member of the team that attended the meeting.
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p class="props">Third In-Project Meetup</p>
				<p>Finally, we could discuss the visual look with the bigger team (developers involved).
					We had an extensive meeting with the designers and developers to discuss doubts, reviews, hear what the developers think about the design and how easy it will be for 
					them to implement it, suggestions and more contributions.
					<br>
					The meeting lasted for over an hour as we had to review each screen of the design comprehensively and as it should be there were feedbacks which I took note of.
					<br><br>
					<strong>At the end of the meeting, the focus became:</strong>
					<br><br>
					<em>Incorporate the feedback given, which was to further simplify certain features I had included with material design elements so the developers could easily work on them.</em>
					<br><br>
					<em>Take out some features and note them for feature updates.
					Better represent some features that seemed complex to the team (since we didn’t do an external usability test, we had to do an internal one).</em>

				<p class="props">The Handoff Process</p>
				<p>A couple more meetings were held in between, eventually, we came to a unilateral agreement of moving forward to development.<br>
				I had to generate all assets I had used in the design into a google drive folder, at the beginning of the high-fidelity designs, I and the other UI designers had created a design system earlier on to our first designs, so that was still in use by me.<br>
				In the meetings held, I had discussed my rationale for each screen, how they link and accounted for different states.<br>
				For complex screens like certain validations, I had created micro-interactions to give developers the insight into how they should work.<br>
				I had also documented each screen to help the devs easily understand how they worked and connected with other screens.<br>
				Finally, the designs were tagged ready for development.

				<p class="props">Challenges/Learnings</p>
				<p>It was quite challenging because I was trying to impress my new employers, I had worked previously but not in a team with more experience in the design role. So, my challenge, firstly, was leaving up to the hype they had built around me while hiring and the creativity in rightly interpreting the problem statement and the visualizing the project itself.
				Secondly, working with devs who had led top organizations in the past was quite challenging for an intern 
				Thirdly, being about to work within the timeline provided and also easily incorporating feedbacks so I don’t work on the same problem twice or more.
				<br><br>
				<strong>My Learning:</strong>
				<br>
				<em>I was open to learning, I had a receptive mind to the feedbacks given. I didn’t see a rejected design as a failure, but as an opportunity to improve on it. </em>
