					<p class="props">The Problem</p>
					<p>In 2020, the world was battling the pandemic of covid-19 and suddenly, the organization 		I had just joined as a UI/UX Designer. 
						My first main design role at any organization.<br><br>
						They decided to take advantage of people likely being indoors for a long time. <br><br>
						One thing about we Africans, most actually, is that we are very religious and would take faith over proof. So when churches were asked not to let their members into physical buildings. People murmured and frowned about it.<br><br>
						So Malon Technologies, decided to bring hope to these people, meaning you could connect with local churches without leaving your house.<br>
						This was a problem because only a very few churches (insignificant number compared to the population of churches in Nigeria) had fully embraced technology.
						<br><br><br><br><br><br>

				<div class="col-md-6">
					<p>My Role</p>
					<p>Yes, we had our first meeting overview with the whole team.
						At this point, the company was pivoting from a digital agency to a product owned company, so this project was going to be taken on priority.
						Our meeting was to discuss the PRD already created for the project. 
						The aim was for the product owner to explain it deeply, discuss roles and see if any suggestions or issues would be raised.
						Eventually, it got to my role, at this point, I hadn’t worked on  a live project ever. Just daily ui challenges from the past.
						I was nervous, really sweaty, yet I was open to embracing the challenge.
						So my role was to bring the product requirement document to life as a designer.<br><br>
						<strong>Things I was going to do were:</strong><br><br>
						<em>UX Research</em><br>
						<em>IA/Low-fi/High-fi designs</em><br>
						<em>Usability Testing</em><br><br>
						Note: At this point I wasn’t sure what to research or how the project might look because it was the first time I was hearing about the project, so I had to take a while to learn about the PRD and be sure I understood the project well enough.

					<p class="props">Our Second Meeting</p>
					<p>The second meeting was to discuss about my understanding of the project and the concerns 	I might have and things I didn’t really understand so I could get more insight.
						<br><br>
						<strong>The Second Meeting Post-focus would then be:</strong>
						<br><br>
						<em>Begin ux research</em>
						<br>
						<em>Set up meeting to discuss insight from research</em>
						<br>
						<em>Use insight to create empathy map, affinity diagram and persona relating to the research</em>
						<br>
						<em>Work on the User Journey Map</em>
						<br>
						<em>Work on the IA</em>
						<br>
						<em>Work on Low-fidelity Designs</em>
						<br>
						<em>Work on High-Fidelity Designs</em>
						<br>
						<em>Hand-off Designs To Developers</em>

					<p>User Research</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Research was broken into two forms:</strong>
						<br><br>
						<em>Qualitative</em>
						<em>Quantitative</em>
						<br>
						I began the qualitative research to help understand how a few churches already solve their issues. Which of them had started deploying online solution to stay abreast with their members in the no-contact times and which hadn’t.
						<br>
						Fortunately, we had team members who had connection with the admins of some churches, so calls were set up with at least 5 chruch admins. We had the calls more than once with about 2 of the admins.
						<br><br>
						<strong>Some of the questions asked asides the informal introductions were open ended like:</strong>
						<br><br>
						<em>The times aren’t favourable for many of us because we 
						have to be at home all the time, can you walk me through how your church works in these times?</em><br><br>
						<em>Has there been a time in the past where physical meetings were impossible and the church had to improvise, what did you do in these times and what caused this eventuality?
						</em>
						<br><br>
						<em>In these times, are there things that have taken a negative  turn in terms of the chruch structure, what are those and how does the church plan on mitigating the risk of decline?</em>
						<br><br>
						and more questions, especially follow-up questions.<br><br>
						<strong>When the qualitative interviews were done, I picked the results and ran more quantitative interviews:</strong><br><br>
						<em>Surveys to see that these were common challenges and concerns acorss multiple churches.</em><br><br>
						<em>Competitive analysis</em>

					<p class="props">Our Fifth Meeting</p>
					<p>The fifth meeting was scheduled to present the high-fidelity designs before it was handed off to developers.<br>
					I had shared my rationale across most of the pages, as they were so much.
					<br>
					My first design maybe, I had to over impress with catering for all states, how they’d look.
					<br>
					I enjoyed it that’s what matters.
					<br><br>
					Action point was to provide assets to developers.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-6">
					<p>Learnings</p>
					<p>I learnt about screen sizes and design scalability. 
						Testing designs across several screens and ensuring they all look good across several screens.<br>
						I learnt about involving developers early on and ensuring they give feedback much early.
						I also learnt about documenting designs as I had to go back and forth explaining what each designs did as developers were developing it.
						<br>
						I also learnt about arranging the files better, using components etc.

					<p class="props">Conclusion</p>
					<p>In between the designs, we had routine calls to discuss the status and feedback was always given, which I worked on and presented in a follow-up routine call.
					It was as intense as my next coming projects, maybe the most intense I had ever been in until then, as it was my first design for DPhi.
					In the end, I had learned about design consistency, UX laws, design laws like balance, rhythm, etc.
