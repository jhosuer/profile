				<h4>The Problem Being Accounted For</h4>
				<p class="header-text">With the constant need for hiring into an existing team or into a new business or
					organization, loads of recruiters struggle with repetitively coming up with tasks that can help
					filter through tons of applications, leaving just the right candidates to interview. Also,
					recruiters struggle with the following as well:<br><br>
					<em>1. Repetitively creating tasks every time there’s a need for hiring</em><br>
					<em>2. Managing hiring history</em><br>
					<em>3. Easily managing the hiring process</em><br>
					<em>4. If platforms already exist, they were too complex or needed
						too much technical know-how</em>
				</p>

			<div class="col-md-6">
				<h4>My Role In The Process</h4>
				<p class="header-text">I was part of a team of 2 UI Designers, 2 UI Design Interns, 2 UX Designers, 1
					Project Manager, 6 Developers and the marketing team I was one of 2 UI Design interns working on my
					first full-scale application.<br><br>
					This was solely assigned to me as there were other projects concurrently going on for the other
					designers and intern.<br><br>
					I was to assist one of the UX Designers in doing a competitive analysis research (Quantitative),
					scale up the findings into quick sketches, low-fidelity mock-ups, then high-fidelity mock-ups with
					incorporating feedbacks in-between the phases

				<h4>Analysing The Problem</h4>
				<p class="header-text">I, the UX team and the project manager had a quick virtual meetup to discuss the
					Product Requirement Document created by the Project manager and the UX Team. After the meeting had
					ended, I had to re-look at the document for a while to see if I might have a doubt or suggestion and
					so on.
					Apparently, the document was vast enough and excited to work on a full-scale
					project asides landing pages I had done in the past, refrained me from having a need for more
					pre-discussions.
					<br><br>So, I began...
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
				<p class="header-text">I began with competitive analysis, with the guidance of the UX team.
					My thoughts were in the region of what type of assessment platforms already exists out there and
					where can I find them.
					Google definitely, it saves stress and time...<br><br>
					<strong>So, I inputted certain keywords like:</strong>
					<br>
					<em>1. Hiring platforms online</em><br>
					<em>2. Hiring Developers online</em><br>
					<em>3. Assessment Platforms Online into google.</em><br><br>
					And trust google, it fed with tons of search results.

			</div>

		<div class="row section-2">
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<h4>...More on The Analysis</h4>
				<p class="header-text">A few stuck out eventually, since I was working for a firm in India but with
					workers across continents,<br><br>
					<strong>I filtered through to the Indian hiring platforms such as:</strong><br>
					<em>1. Datacamp for Business</em><br>
					<em>2. Hackerearth</em><br>
					<em>3. Hackerrank</em><br>
					<em>4. Dataquest</em><br><br><br>
					My goal was to understand what worked on these platforms and why they did or what didn’t.<br><br>
					<strong>Things I did on each:</strong>
					<br>
					<em>Search and read some reviews on each platform I added to the competitive analysis sheet that was
						created by the UX team</em><br>
					<em>Created a temporary account on it and work through it while comparing it to the reviews I had
						earlier read</em><br>
					<em>Added the strength, weakness, opportunities and threat of each to the analysis sheet</em><br>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<h4>First In-Project Meetup</h4>
				<p class="header-text">So, the team met to discuss the findings from the sub-quantitative research and
					comprehensively expanded on each finding, sharing personal discoveries and ideas on how to progress
					to defining our problem statement.<br><br>
					<strong>The key focus of the post-meetup were centered around the following</strong>
					<br>
					<em>1. How might we make the hiring platform for business owners seamless enough that it can provide
						the best set of employees for a given field with the least amount of effort required.</em><br>
					<em>2. How might we make the weaknesses we’ve discovered a part of our strength</em><br>
					<em>3. How might we ensure the seamless communication between hiring managers and candidates via the
						platform without making it look like a spam or bother.</em>

					<em>1.As a hiring manager, I would love to easily schedule a variety of hiring challenges and filter

					<em>2. As a hiring manager, I would love to be able to retrace previous applicants, should there be

				<h4>Second In-Project Meetup</h4>
				<p class="header-text">Asides, the regular, daily stand-up meetings, project meetup are specific to
					project roadblocks, brainstorming and more, since we all work remotely.<br><br>
					This meetup was for me to present my work to the team. At this point,
					I had gotten the low-fi designs up to a reasonable extent.
					The aim of the meeting for me was to get feedback on the direction of the project.<br><br>
					<strong>The key focus of the post-meetup were centered around the following:</strong><br>
					<em>How the solution solved the problem statement I had come up with.</em><br>
					<em>What the team thought about the information architecture of the solution</em><br>
					<em>How well the visual placement of elements resonates with the team (Just opinions). Since the
						main judgement is in the high-fidelity designs.</em>

					As it should be, there were feedbacks provided from every
					member of the team that attended the meeting.

			<div class="col-md-6">
				<h4>Third In-Project Meetup</h4>
				<p class="header-text">
					Finally, we could discuss the visual look with the bigger team (developers involved). We had an
					extensive meeting with the designers and developers to discuss doubts, reviews, hear what the
					developers think about the design and how easy it will be for them to implement it, suggestions and
					more contributions.<br><br>
					The meeting lasted for over an hour as we had to review each screen of the design comprehensively
					and as it should be there were feedbacks which I took note of.<br><br>
					<strong>At the end of the meeting, the focus became:</strong><br>
					<em>1. Incorporate the feedback given, which was to further simplify certain features I had included
						with material design elements so the developers could easily work on them.</em><br>
					<em>2. Take out some features and note them for feature updates.
						Better represent some features that seemed complex to the team (since we didn’t do an external
						usability test, we had to do an internal one).</em><br>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6 pross">
				<h4>The Handoff Process</h4>
				<p class="header-text">A couple more meetings were held in between, eventually, we came to a unilateral
					agreement of moving forward to development.<br><br>
					<em>1.I had to generate all assets I had used in the design into a google drive folder, at the
						beginning of the high-fidelity designs, I and the other UI designers had created a design system
						earlier on to our first designs, so that was still in use by me.</em><br><br>
					<em>2. In the meetings held, I had discussed my rationale for each screen, how they link and
						accounted for different states.</em><br><br>
					<em>3. For complex screens like certain validations, I had created micro-interactions to give
						developers the insight into how they should work.
						4. I had also documented each screen to help the devs easily understand how they worked and
						connected with other screens.</em><br><br>
					<em>5. Finally, the designs were tagged ready for development.</em>

				<h4>Challenges/Learnings</h4>
				<p class="header-text">It was quite challenging because I was trying to impress my new employers, I had
					worked
					previously but not in a team with more experience in the design role. So, my challenge, firstly, was
					leaving up to the hype they had built around me while hiring and the creativity in rightly
					interpreting the problem statement and the visualizing the project itself.
					<br><br>Secondly, working with devs who had led top organizations in the past was quite challenging
					for an intern
					<br><br>Thirdly, being about to work within the timeline provided and also easily incorporating
					feedbacks so I don’t work on the same problem twice or more.
					<br><br><strong>My Learning:</strong><br>
					<em>I was open to learning, I had a receptive mind to the feedbacks given. I didn’t see a rejected
						design as a failure, but as an opportunity to improve on it.</em> <br><br>Live URL of the
