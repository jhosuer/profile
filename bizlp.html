					<p class="props">The Problem</p>
					<p>When I joined DPhi, the exisiting designs didn’t fully interpret the vision of the organization especially the information hierarchy on the main landing page.<br><br>
						Not to talk about the visual appeal as well.<br><br>Also, the interaction design wasn’t great especially for the data challenge pages. It looked cluttered and still didn’t interpret the vision of  DPhi and make the company look like a worthwhile competitor to its competition.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-6">
					<p>My Role</p>
					<p>I was assigned a few landing pages to work on while some where assigned to other designers.<br><br>
						The ones I was assigned are the DPhi’s main homepage, individual landing page, live-session landing page, assessment landing page,about us page, business landing page.<br><br>
						I was the sole UI designer for these pages while feedback was delivered by the UX team as well as the project manager, the engineering team, other ui designers and ocassionally, the product owner.
					</p>

				<div class="col-md-6 top">
					<p class="h3">Business Landing Page</p>
					<p>The idea around the business landing page is to discuss both the Crowdsourcing AI platform which was designed by a different designer and the Assessment platform which was designed by me.

					So, the challenge here was being able to sell two different products without complicating the design with information overload. I followed the same structure as the other landing pages.</p>
					</p>
					<br><br>
					<img src="img/mh.png" alt="direction">
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-6">
					<p>However, this design took a while as concepts like the following were constantly deliberated on:</p>
					<p>What should a user see first when they land on the page<br><br>
						What will a user prioritize doing on the page, immediately they understand the <br>essence of the page.
					</p>
					<br><br>

			<div class="row text conclusion bizlpconclusion">
				<div class="offset-md-3 col-md-8 top">
					<p class="props">...</p>
					<p>To solve the following, we had to prioritize the ‘skimmer’ while also considering the ‘in depth’.
						The skimmer and the in depth are fictional users of the page.
						The skimmer just needs very little overview to take an action while the in depth, although he doesn’t fully correlate with its title, needs just a little more than the skimmer to ‘slowly’ take an action.
						After several IA, having the main actionable items reside in the hero section of the page became the focal point of the business landing page.
						In this context, the actionable items were the cards which talked about the individual business platforms, alongside the know more primary buttons to trigger action.

					<p class="props">Conclusion</p>
					<p>In between the designs, we had routine calls to discuss the status and feedback was always given, 		which I worked on and presented in a follow-up routine call.
						It was as intense as my next coming projects, maybe the most intense I had ever been in until then, as it was my first design for DPhi.

						In the end, I had learned about design consistency, UX laws, design laws like balance, rhythm, etc.
